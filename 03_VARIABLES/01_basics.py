# In  Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it using the assighment operator (=).

age = 34 # integer
name = "Raju" # string 
cgpa = 4.55 # float

# Rule of defining a variable in Python
# Variable names mujst start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an understore (_).
# They can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names are case-sensitive (age and Age are different).
# Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., if, for, while) as variable names.

34age = 4 # Invalid because variable cannot star with a number
age = 32 # Valid because variable can start with a number
a$$ge = 45 # Invalid because variables cannot contain special characters other than _
_age = 34
_nice_45 = 34
a_b_c_7 = 34
a_b_c_7 = "Sam"
